# CMPS 6730 Sample Project

This repository contains starter code for the final project in CMPS 4730/6730: Natural Language Processing at Tulane University.

The code in this repository will be copied into your team's project repository at the start of class to provide a starting point for your project.

You should edit this file to include a summary of the goals, methods, and conclusions of your project.

The structure of the code supports the following:

- A simple web UI using Flask to support a demo of the project
- A command-line interface to support running different stages of the project's pipeline
- The ability to easily reproduce your work on another machine by using virtualenv and providing access to external data sources.

### Using this repository

- At the start of the course, students will be divided into project teams. Each team will receive a copy of this starter code in a new repository. E.g.:
https://github.com/tulane-cmps6730/project-alpha
- Each team member will then clone their team repository to their personal computer to work on their project. E.g.: `git clone https://github.com/tulane-cmps6730/project-alpha`
- See [GettingStarted.md](GettingStarted.md) for instructions on using the starter code.

### Background Resources

The following will give you some technical background on the technologies used here:

1. Refresh your Python by completing this online tutorial: <https://www.learnpython.org/> (3 hours)
2. Create a GitHub account at <https://github.com/>
3. Setup git by following <https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git> (30 minutes)
4. Learn git by completing the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) tutorial, reading the [git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), then completing the [Managing merge conflicts](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) tutorial (1 hour).
5. Install the Python data science stack from <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/> . **We will use Python 3** (30 minutes)
6. Complete the scikit-learn tutorial from <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python> (2 hours)
